A, in the exercise, to the \nbest of his judgment exerted in good faith, of the power which the law gives to \nall persons of apprehending murderers in the act, seizes Z, in order to bring Z \nbefore the proper authorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn \nout that Z was acting in self-defence. \n \n \nAccident in the doing of a lawful act \n \n80. Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, \nand without any criminal intention or knowledge, in the doing of a \nlawful act in a lawful manner, by lawful means, and with proper care \nand caution. \n \n \nILLUSTRATION \n \nA is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing \nby. Here, if there was no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act is \nexcusable and not an offence. \n \n \nAct likely to cause harm but done without a criminal intent, and \nto prevent other harm \n \n81. Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the \nknowledge that it is likely to cause harm, if it be done without any \ncriminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of \npreventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.\n\n52                                         Laws of Malaysia                      ACT 574 \n \n \n \nExplanation\u2014It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be \nprevented or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse \nthe risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm. \n \n \nILLUSTRATIONS \n \n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or \nnegligence on his part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop \nhis vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with 20 or 30 passengers on \nboard, unless he changes the course of his vessel; and that, by changing his \ncourse, he must incur risk of running down a boat, C, with only two passengers \non board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any \nintention to run down the boat C, and in good faith for the purposes of avoiding \nthe danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though \nhe may run down the boat C, by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause \nthat effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to \navoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down the boat \nC. \n \n(b) A in a great fire pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration \nfrom spreading. He does this with the intention, in good faith, of saving human \nlife or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a \nnature and so imminent as to excuse A\u2019s act, A is not guilty of the offence. \n \n \nAct of a child under 10 years of age \n \n82.

If the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to \ncommit which, occasions the exercise of the right of private defence, \nis theft, mischief or criminal trespass, not of any of the descriptions \nenumerated in section 103, that right does not extend to the voluntary \ncausing of death, but does extend subject to the restrictions mentioned \nin section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrongdoer of any harm \nother than death. \n \n \nCommencement and continuance of the right of private defence of \nproperty \n \n105.

If, in the exercise of the right of private defence against an \nassault which reasonably causes the apprehension of death, the \ndefender is so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right \nwithout risk of harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence \nextends to the running of that risk. \n \n \nILLUSTRATION \n \n A is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him.

A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder. \n  \nExplanation 3\u2014It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable \nby law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention \nor knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge. \n \n \nILLUSTRATIONS \n \n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act \nwhich would be an offence if committed by a person capable by law of \ncommitting an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the \nact is committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence. \n \n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven \nyears of age, to do an act which causes Z\u2019s death. B, in consequence of  the  \nabetment,  does  the  act,  and  thereby  causes  Z\u2019s  death.  Here, though B was \nnot capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the \nsame manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence and had \ncommitted murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \n \n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling house. B, in consequence of the \nunsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or \nthat he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in \nconsequence of A\u2019s instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of \nabetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling house, and is liable to the \npunishment provided for that offence. \n \n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take \nproperty belonging to Z out of Z\u2019s possession. A induces B to believe that the \nproperty belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z\u2019s possession, in good faith \nbelieving it to be A\u2019s property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take \ndishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, \nand is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \n \nExplanation 4\u2014The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment \nof such an abetment is also an offence.\n\nPenal Code                                            67 \n \nILLUSTRATION \n \nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to \nmurder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of B\u2019s instigation. B is \nliable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and as A \ninstigated B to commit the offence A is also liable to the same punishment. \n \nExplanation 5\u2014It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of \nabetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the \nperson who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in \npursuance of which the offence is committed. \n \n \nILLUSTRATION \n \nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer \nthe poison. B then explains the plan to C, mentioning that a third person is to \nadminister the poison, but without mentioning A\u2019s name. C agrees to procure the \npoison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the \nmanner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, \nthough A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the \nconspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore \ncommitted the offence defined in this section, and is liable to the punishment for \nmurder. \n \n \nAbetment in Malaysia of offences outside Malaysia \n \n108A. \nA person abets an offence within the meaning of this Code who, \nin Malaysia, abets the commission of any act without and beyond \nMalaysia which would constitute an offence if committed in Malaysia. \n \n \nILLUSTRATION \n \nA, in Malaysia, instigates B, a foreigner in Java, to commit murder in Java. \nA is guilty of abetting murder. \n \n \nPunishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in \nconsequence, and where no express provision is made for its \npunishment \n \n109. Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed\n\n68                                         Laws of Malaysia                      ACT 574 \n \n \nin consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by \nthis Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the \npunishment provided for the offence. \n \nExplanation\u2014An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of \nabetment, when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in \npursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which constitutes the abetment. \n \n \nILLUSTRATIONS \n \n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A   some \nfavour in the exercise of B\u2019s official functions. B accepts the bribe. A has abetted \nthe offence defined in section 161. \n \n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the \ninstigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is \nliable to the same punishment as B. \n \n(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, \nprocures the poison and delivers it to B, in order that he may administer it to Z. \nB, in pursuance of the conspiracy administers the poison to Z in A\u2019s absence and \nthereby causes Z\u2019s death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that \noffence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. \n \n \nPunishment of abetment if the person abetted does the act with a \ndifferent intention from that of the abettor \n \n110. Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person \nabetted does the act with a different intention or knowledge from that of \nthe abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence \nwhich would have been committed if the act had been done with the \nintention or knowledge of the abettor and with no other. \n \n \nLiability of abettor when one act is abetted and a different act is \ndone \n \n111. When an act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is \nliable for the act done, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as \nif he had directly abetted it:\n\nPenal Code                                            69 \n \n \nProvided that the act done was a probable consequence of the \nabetment, and was committed under the influence of the instigation, or \nwith the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the \nabetment. \n \n \nILLUSTRATIONS \n \n(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him \npoison for that purpose. The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake \nputs the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side of that of Z. Here, if the \nchild was acting under the influence of A\u2019s instigation, and the act done was \nunder the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in \nthe same manner, and to the same extent, as if he had instigated the child to put \nthe poison into the food of Y. \n \n(b) A instigates B to burn Z\u2019s house. B sets fire to the house, and at the same \ntime commits theft of property there. A, though guilty of the burning of the \nhouse, is not guilty of abetting the theft for the theft was a distinct act, and not a \nprobable consequence of the burning. \n \n(c) A, instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for \nthe purpose of robbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C \nbreak into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, \nif that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the \npunishment provided for murder. \n \n \nAbettor, when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and \nfor act done \n \n112. If the act for which the abettor is liable under section 111 is \ncommitted in addition to the act abetted, and constitutes a distinct \noffence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. \n \n \nILLUSTRATION \n \nA instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in \nconsequence, resists that distress. In offering the resistance, B voluntarily causes \ngrievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the \noffence of resisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous \nhurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and if A knew that B was\n\n70                                         Laws of Malaysia                      ACT 574 \n \n \nlikely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress, A will also be \nliable to punishment for each of the offences. \n \n \nLiability of abettor for an offence caused by the act abetted \ndifferent from that intended by the abettor \n \n113. When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the \nabettor of causing a particular effect, and an act for which the abettor \nis liable in consequence of the abetment causes a different effect from \nthat intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, \nin the same manner, and to the same extent, as if he had abetted the act \nwith the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the act \nabetted was likely to cause that effect. \n \n \nILLUSTRATION \n \nA instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z, B, in consequence of the \ninstigation, causes grievous hurt to Z. Z dies in consequence. Here, if A knew \nthat the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death,  A is liable to be punished \nwith the punishment provided for murder. \n \n \nAbettor present when offence committed \n \n114. Whenever any person who, if absent, would be liable to be \npunished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he \nwould be punishable in consequence of the abetment is committed, he \nshall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. \n \n \nAbetment of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment \nfor life \n \n115. Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with \ndeath or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term which may \nextend to twenty years, shall, if that offence is not committed in \nconsequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this \nCode for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with\n\nPenal Code                                            71 \n \nimprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall \nalso be liable to fine; and shall if any act for which the abettor is liable \nin consequence of the abetment and which causes hurt to any person, \nis done, the abettor shall be liable to imprisonment for a term which \nmay extend to fourteen years, and shall also  be liable to fine. \n \n \nILLUSTRATION \n \nA instigates B to murder Z.

The punishment of gang-robbery is imprisonment \nfor life, or imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, with or \nwithout fine. A, therefore, is liable to such imprisonment, with or without fine.\n\n136                                         Laws of Malaysia                      ACT 574 \n \n \nUsing evidence known to be false \n \n196.

Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of \ncausing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is \nlikely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such \nact to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. \n \n \nILLUSTRATIONS \n \n(a)  A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing \ndeath, or with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Z, \nbelieving the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has \ncommitted the offence of culpable homicide. \n \n(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to \ncause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z\u2019s death, induces B to fire at the bush. \nB fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence, but A has committed the \noffence of culpable homicide. \n \n(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is \nbehind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, although A was doing an \nunlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill \nB, or to cause death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death. \n \nExplanation 1\u2014A person who causes bodily injury to another who is \nlabouring under a disorder, disease, or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates \nthe death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death. \n \nExplanation 2\u2014Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who \ncauses such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by \nresorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been \nprevented.\n\n174                                         Laws of Malaysia                      ACT 574 \n \n \nExplanation 3\u2014The causing of the death of a child in the mother\u2019s womb \nis not homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a \nliving child, if any part of that child has been brought forth, though the child \nmay not have breathed or been completely born. \n \n \nMurder \n \n300. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is \nmurder\u2014 \n \n(a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the \nintention of causing death; \n \n(b) if it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury \nas the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the \nperson to whom the harm is caused; \n \n(c) if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to \nany person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted \nis sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; \nor \n \n(d) if the person committing the act knows that it is so \nimminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause \ndeath, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and \ncommits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk \nof causing death, or such injury as aforesaid. \n \n \nILLUSTRATIONS \n \n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence.  A \ncommits murder. \n \n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely \nto cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies \nin consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not \nhave been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a \nperson in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under \nany disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature \nkill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause\n\nPenal Code                                            175 \n \nbodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such \nbodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \n \n(c) \nA intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause \nthe death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here \nA is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z\u2019s death. \n \n(d) A, without any excuse, fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons \nand kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a \npremeditated design to kill any particular individual. \n \nException 1\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst \ndeprived of the power of self control by grave and sudden provocation, causes \nthe death of the person who gave the provocation, or causes the death of any \nother person by mistake or accident. \n \nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos: \n \n(a)  that the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the \noffender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person; \n \n(b) that the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the \nlaw, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such \npublic servant; \n \n(c)  that the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful \nexercise of the right of private defence. \n \nExplanation\u2014Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to \nprevent the offence from amounting to murder, is a question of fact. \n \n \nILLUSTRATIONS \n \n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, \nintentionally kills Y, Z\u2019s child. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation \nwas not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by \naccident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation. \n \n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a \npistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who \nis near him, but out of sight.  A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, \nbut merely culpable homicide. \n \n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent \npassion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the \nprovocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise \nof his powers.\n\n176                                         Laws of Malaysia                      ACT 574 \n \n \n \n (d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe \na word of A\u2019s deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to \nsudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \n \n(e) A attempts to pull Z\u2019s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, \nlays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and \nviolent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the \nprovocation was given by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private \ndefence. \n \n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, \nintending to take advantage of B\u2019s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a \nknife into B\u2019s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife.  Here  B  may  \nhave  committed  only  culpable  homicide,  but  A  is guilty of murder. \n \nException  2\u2014Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the  offender,  in the \nexercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, \nexceeds the power given to him by law, and causes the death of  the person  \nagainst whom he  is exercising such right of defence, without premeditation  and  \nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of \nsuch defence. \n \n \nILLUSTRATION \n \nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt \nto A.  A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A, believing in good faith \nthat he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots \nZ dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. \n \nException 3\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a \npublic servant, or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public \njustice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an \nact which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due \ndischarge of his duty as such public servant, and without ill will towards the \nperson whose death is caused. \n \nException 4\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without \npremeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and \nwithout the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual \nmanner. \n \nExplanation\u2014It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the \nprovocation or commits the first assault.\n\nPenal Code                                            177 \n \nException 5\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose \ndeath is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death, or takes \nthe risk of death with his own consent. \n \n \nILLUSTRATION \n \nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age, \nto commit suicide. Here, on account of Z\u2019s youth, he was incapable of giving \nconsent to his own death. A has therefore abetted murder. \n \n \nCulpable homicide by causing the death of a person other than the \nperson whose death was intended \n \n301. If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be \nlikely to cause death, commits culpable homicide by causing the death \nof any person whose death he neither intends nor knows himself to be \nlikely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of \nthe description of which it would have been if he had caused the death \nof the person whose death he intended or knew himself to be likely to \ncause. \n \n \nPunishment for murder \n \n302. Whoever commits murder shall be punished with death. \n \n \n303. (There is no s. 303). \n \n \nPunishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder \n \n304. Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder \nshall be punished\u2014 \n \n(a) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to thirty \nyears, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by which the \ndeath is caused is done with the intention of causing death,\n\n178                                         Laws of Malaysia                      ACT 574 \n \n \nor of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death; \nor \n \n(b) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten \nyears or with fine or with both, if the act is done with the \nknowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any \nintention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as \nis likely to cause death. \n \n \nCausing death by negligence \n \n304A. Whoever causes the death of any person, by doing any rash or \nnegligence act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished \nwith imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with \nfine or with both. \n \n \nAbetment of suicide of child or insane person \n \n305. If any person under eighteen years of age, any insane person, \nany delirious person, any idiot, or any person in a state of intoxication, \ncommits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide shall \nbe punished with death or imprisonment for a term which may extend \nto twenty years, and shall also be liable to fine. \n \n \nAbetment of suicide \n \n306. If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission \nof such suicide shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which \nmay extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. \n \n \nAttempt to murder \n \n307. (1) Whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge \nand under such circumstances, that if he by that act caused death he \nwould be guilty of murder, shall be punished with imprisonment for a\n\nPenal Code                                            179 \n \nterm which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; \nand if hurt is caused to any person by such act, the offender shall be \nliable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to twenty years. \n \n(2) When any person offending under this section is under sentence \nof imprisonment for life or for a term of twenty years, he may, if hurt \nis caused, be punished with death. \n \n \nILLUSTRATIONS \n \n(a) A shoots at Z with intention to kill him, under such circumstances that, \nif death ensued, A would be guilty of murder. A is liable to punishment under \nthis section. \n \n(b) A, with the intention of causing the death of a child of tender years, \nexposes it in a desert place. A has committed the offence defined by this section, \nthough the death of the child does not ensue. \n \n(c)  A, intending to murder Z, buys a gun and loads it. A has not yet \ncommitted the offence. A fires the gun at Z. He has committed the offence \ndefined in this section; and if by such firing he wounds Z, he is liable to the \npunishment by the latter part of this section. \n \n(d) A, intending to murder Z by poison, purchases poison and mixes the \nsame with food which remains in A\u2019s keeping; A has not yet committed the \noffence defined in this section.  A places the food on Z\u2019s table or delivers it to \nZ\u2019s servants to place it on Z\u2019s table. A has committed the offence defined in this \nsection. \n \n \nAttempt to commit culpable homicide \n \n308. Whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge and \nunder such circumstances that if he by that act caused death he would \nbe guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, shall be \npunished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three \nyears or with fine or with both; and if hurt is caused to any person by \nsuch act, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may \nextend to seven years or with fine or with both.\n\n180                                         Laws of Malaysia                      ACT 574 \n \n \nILLUSTRATION \n \nA, on grave and sudden provocation, fires a pistol at Z, under such \ncircumstances that if he thereby caused death he would be guilty of culpable \nhomicide not amounting to murder.

Whoever attempts to commit suicide, and does any act towards \nthe commission of such offence, shall be punished with imprisonment \nfor a term which may extend to one year or with fine or with both. \n \n \nInfanticide \n \n309A. When any woman by any wilful act or omission causes the \ndeath of her newly-born child, but at the time of the act or omission \nshe had not fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to such child, \nand by reason thereof the balance of her mind was then disturbed, she \nshall, notwithstanding that the circumstances were such that but for \nthis section the offence would have amounted to murder, be guilty of \nthe offence of infanticide. \n \n \nPunishment for infanticide \n \n309B. Whoever commits the offence of infanticide shall be punished \nat the discretion of the Court, with imprisonment for a term which may \nextend to twenty years, and shall also be liable to fine. \n \n \n310\u2013311. \n(There are no ss. 310\u2013311).\n\nPenal Code                                            181 \n \nCausing Miscarriage; Injuries to Unborn Children; Exposure \nof Infants; and Concealment of Births \n \n \nCausing miscarriage \n \n312.

Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that \nperson\u2019s consent, in order to cause the committing of any offence, or \nintending by the use of such force illegally to cause, or knowing it to \nbe likely that by the use of such force he will illegally cause injury, \nfear, or annoyance to the person to whom the force is used, is said to \nuse criminal force to that other. \n \n \nILLUSTRATIONS \n \n(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and \nthus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the stream. Here A intentionally \ncauses motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner \nthat the motion is produced without any other act on any person\u2019s part. A has \ntherefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z\u2019s consent, \nin order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely \nthat this use of force will cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z. A has used \ncriminal force to Z. \n \n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z\u2019s horses, and thereby causes them to \nquicken their pace. Here A has caused change of motion to Z by inducing the \nanimals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has \ndone this without Z\u2019s consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may \nthereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has committed criminal force to Z.\n\nPenal Code                                            195 \n \n(c)  Z is riding in a carriage. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the horse and stops \nthe carriage. Here A has caused cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this \nby his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted \nthus intentionally without Z\u2019s consent, in order to the commission of an offence, \nA has used criminal force to Z. \n \n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own \nbodily power moved his own person so as to bring it into contact with Z.  He  \nhas  therefore  intentionally  used  force  to  Z,  and  if  he  has done so without \nZ\u2019s consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, \nfrighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \n \n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be \nthus brought into contact with Z, or with Z\u2019s clothes, or with something carried  by \nZ, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z\u2019s clothes, or something \ncarried by Z. Here if the throwing of the stone produces the effect of causing any \nsubstance to come into contact with Z, or Z\u2019s clothes, A has used force to Z; and if \nhe did so without Z\u2019s consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he \nhas used criminal force to Z. \n \n(f) A intentionally pulls up a woman\u2019s veil.  Here A intentionally uses force \nto her; and if he does so without her consent, intending or knowing it to be likely \nthat he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to \nher. \n \n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. \nHere A intentionally by his own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling \nwater as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated \nthat such contact must affect Z\u2019s sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally \nused force to Z; and if he has done this without Z\u2019s consent, intending or knowing \nit to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has \nused criminal force. \n \n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z\u2019s consent. Here, if A intends \nto cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses criminal force to Z. \n \n(i)  A, a head teacher, in the reasonable exercise of his discretion as head \nteacher, canes B, one of his scholars. A does not use criminal force to B because, \nalthough A intends to cause fear and annoyance, he does not use force illegally. \n \n \nAssault \n \n351. Whoever makes any gesture or any preparation, intending or \nknowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any \nperson present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or\n\n196                                         Laws of Malaysia                      ACT 574 \n \n \npreparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to \ncommit an assault. \n \n \nExplanation\u2014Mere words do not amount to an assault.  But  the words \nwhich a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a  meaning  as  \nmay  make  those  gestures  or  preparations  amount  to  an assault. \n \n \nILLUSTRATIONS \n \n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may \nthereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike Z. A has committed an assault. \n \n(b) A  begins  to  unloose  the  muzzle  of  a  ferocious  dog,  intending or \nknowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that he is about to \ncause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z. \n \n(c)  A takes up a stick, saying to Z, \u201cI will give you a beating\u201d. Here, though the \nwords used by A could in no case amount to an assault, and though the mere gesture, \nunaccompanied by any other circumstances might not amount to an assault, the \ngesture explained by the words may amount to an assault. \n \n \nPunishment for using criminal force otherwise than on grave \nprovocation \n \n352. Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than \non grave and sudden provocation given by that person, shall be punished with \nimprisonment for a term which may extend to three months or with fine \nwhich may extend to one thousand ringgit or with both. \n \nExplanation\u2014Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the \npunishment for an offence under this section, if the provocation is sought or \nvoluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for the offence; \n \nif the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law or by a \npublic servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant; or \n \nif the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the \nright of private defence. \n \nWhether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the \noffence, is a question of fact.\n\nPenal Code                                            197 \n \n \nPunishment for using criminal force by spouse \n \n352A.

Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, intending \nto outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the \nmodesty of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term \nwhich may extend to ten years or with fine or with whipping or with \nany two of such punishments. \n \n \nAssault or criminal force with intent to dishonour a person, \notherwise than on grave provocation \n \n355. Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, intending \nthereby to dishonour that person, otherwise than on grave and sudden \nprovocation given by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment \nfor a term which may extend to two years or with fine or with both.\n\n198                                         Laws of Malaysia                      ACT 574 \n \n \nAssault or criminal force in attempt to commit theft of property \ncarried by a person \n \n356.

Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property \nout of the possession of any person without that person\u2019s consent, \nmoves that property  in  order to such taking, is said to commit theft. \n \n Explanation 1\u2014A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being \nmovable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the \nsubject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. \n \nExplanation 2\u2014A moving, effected by the same act which effects the \nseverance, may be a theft.\n\nPenal Code                                            213 \n \nExplanation 3\u2014A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an \nobstacle which prevented it from moving, or by separating it from any other \nthing, as well as by actually moving it. \n \nExplanation  4\u2014A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is \nsaid to move that animal, and to move everything which in consequence of the \nmotion so caused is moved by that animal. \n \nExplanation 5\u2014The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or \nimplied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person \nhaving for that purpose authority either express or implied. \n \n \nILLUSTRATIONS \n \n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z\u2019s ground, with the intention of dishonestly \ntaking the tree out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent. Here, as soon as  A  has  \nsevered  the  tree  in  order  to  such  taking,  he  has  committed theft. \n \n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z\u2019s dog to follow \nit. Here, if A\u2019s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z\u2019s possession \nwithout Z\u2019s consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z\u2019s dog has begun to \nfollow A. \n \n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a \ncertain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as \nthe bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. \n \n(d) A, being Z\u2019s servant and entrusted by Z with the care of Z\u2019s plate, \ndishonestly runs away with the plate without Z\u2019s consent. A has committed theft. \n \n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, \ntill Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate \nwas not in Z\u2019s possession. It could not, therefore, be taken out of Z\u2019s possession, \nand A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach \nof trust. \n \n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which he occupies. \nHere the ring is in Z\u2019s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits \ntheft. \n \n(g) A finds a ring lying on the high road, not in the possession of any \nperson.  A  by  taking  it  commits  no  theft,  though  he  may  commit criminal \nmisappropriation of property. \n \n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z\u2019s house. Not venturing \nto misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides \nthe ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z,\n\n214                                         Laws of Malaysia                      ACT 574 \n \n \nwith the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when \nthe loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft. \n \n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his \nshop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully \ndetain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, take his watch by force \nout of Z\u2019s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed \ncriminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did \nwas not done dishonestly. \n \n(j)  If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the  watch  \nlawfully  as  a  security  for  the  debt,  and  A  takes  the  watch out of Z\u2019s \npossession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his \ndebt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \n \n(k)  Again, if A having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z\u2019s possession \nwithout Z\u2019s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits \ntheft, though the watch is his own property, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \n \n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\u2019s possession, without Z\u2019s  \nconsent,  with  the  intention  of  keeping  it  until  he  obtains  money from Z as \na reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed \ntheft. \n \n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\u2019s library in Z\u2019s absence \nand takes away a book, without Z\u2019s express consent, for the purpose  merely  of  \nreading  it,  and  with  the  intention  of  returning  it. Here, it is probable that A \nmay have conceived that he had Z\u2019s implied consent to use Z\u2019s book. If this was \nA\u2019s impression, A has not committed theft. \n \n(n) A asks charity from Z\u2019s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, \nwhich A, knows to belong to Z, her husband. Here it is probable that A may \nconceive that Z\u2019s wife is authorized to give away alms. If this was A\u2019s \nimpression, A has not committed theft. \n \n(o) A is the paramour of Z\u2019s wife.  She gives A valuable property, which A \nknows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority \nfrom Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \n \n(p) A in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\u2019s own \nproperty, takes that property out of B\u2019s possession. Here, as A does not take \ndishonestly, he does not commit theft.\n\nPenal Code                                            215 \n \nPunishment for theft \n \n379.

A person is said to make a false document\u2014 \n \n(a) who dishonestly or fraudulently makes, signs, seals or \nexecutes a document or part of a document, or makes any \nmark denoting the execution of a document, with the \nintention of causing it to be believed that such document or \npart of a document was made, signed, sealed or executed\n\nPenal Code                                            249 \n \nby, or by the authority of a person by whom or by whose \nauthority he knows that it was not  made, signed, sealed or \nexecuted, or at a time at which he knows that it was not \nmade, signed, sealed or executed; \n \n(b) who without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, \nby cancellation or otherwise, alters a document in any \nmaterial part thereof, after it has been made or executed \neither by himself or by any other person, whether such \nperson be living or dead at the time of such alteration; or \n \n(c) who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, \nseal, execute or alter a document, knowing  that such \nperson by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication \ncannot, or that by reason of deception practised upon him \nhe does not, know the contents of the document or the \nnature of the alteration. \n \n \nILLUSTRATIONS \n \n(a)  A has a letter of credit upon B for ringgit 1,000 written by Z. A in order \nto defraud B, adds a cypher to the 1,000, and makes the sum 10,000, intending \nthat it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery. \n \n(b)  A, without Z\u2019s authority, affixes Z\u2019s seal to a document, purporting to \nbe a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate \nto B, and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase money. A has committed \nforgery. \n \n(c)  A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but \nwithout any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the \ncheque by inserting the sum of one thousand ringgit. A commits forgery. \n \n(d)  A leaves with B his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without \ninserting the sum payable, and authorizes B to fill up the cheque by inserting a \nsum not exceeding one thousand ringgit for the purpose of making certain \npayments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten \nthousand. B commits forgery. \n \n(e)  A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B\u2019s \nauthority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker, and intending \nto take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive \nthe banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby\n\n250                                         Laws of Malaysia                      ACT 574 \n \n \nto discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \n \n(f) Z\u2019s will  contains  these  words:  \u201cI  direct  that  all  my  remaining \nproperty be equally divided between A, B and C\u201d. A dishonestly scratches out \nB\u2019s name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself \nand C. A has committed forgery. \n \n(g) A endorses a promissory note and makes it payable to Z, or his order, \nby writing on the bill the words \u201cPay to Z, or his order\u201d, and signing the \nendorsement. B dishonestly erases the words \u201cPay to Z, or his order\u201d, and \nthereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits \nforgery. \n \n(h)  A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z \nof his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months \nearlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he \nhad conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed \nforgery. \n \n(i)  Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee \nfrom the legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the \nwill according to his instruction, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed \nforgery. \n \n(j) A writes a letter and sign sit with B\u2019s name without B\u2019s authority, \ncertifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances \nfrom unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms \nfrom Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce \nZ to part with property, A has committed forgery. \n \n(k) A without B\u2019s authority writes a letter and signs it in B\u2019s name, \ncertifying to A\u2019s character, intending there by to obtain employment under Z. A \nhas committed forgery, inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged \ncertificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract \nfor service. \n \nExplanation 1\u2014A man\u2019s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. \n \n \nILLUSTRATIONS \n \n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be \nbelieved that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has \ncommitted forgery. \n \n(b) A writes the word \u201caccepted\u201d on a piece of paper and signs it with Z\u2019s\n\nPenal Code                                            251 \n \nname, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange \ndrawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. \nA is guilty of forgery; and if B knowing the fact draws the bill upon the paper \npursuant to A\u2019s intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \n \n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person \nof the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to \nbe believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable: \nhere A has committed forgery. \n \n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B.  \nB after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the \nestate to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period, and dates the lease six months \nprior to the seizure with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that \nthe lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his \nown name, commits forgery by antedating it. \n \n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for  A\u2019s  \nbenefit,  and  with  intent  to  defraud  his  creditors, and  in  order to give  a  \ncolour  to  the  transaction,  writes  a  promissory  note,  binding himself to pay \nto B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be \nbelieved to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has \ncommitted forgery under the first head of the definition. \n \nExplanation 2\u2014The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious \nperson, intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or \nin the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was \nmade by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery. \n \n \nILLUSTRATION \n \nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts  \nthe bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits \nforgery. \n \n \nPunishment for forgery \n \n465.
